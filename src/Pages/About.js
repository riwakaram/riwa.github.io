                        Gamification of Virtual Reality Kitchen Scenarios

                        <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                        Virtual Reality (VR) technology provides promising
                        results when employed in educational applications. It
                        offers an interactive environment which improves and
                        accelerates the education and simulation experience.
                        Thus, implementing a VR Kitchen helps the users acquire
                        the skills needed to correctly utilize a professional
                        kitchen, i.e., protect oneself from the steam exiting
                        the oven and correctly distinguishing and separating
                        corrosive and non-corrosive substances. Additionally, it
                        allows the flexibility of creating different training
                        scenarios, some of which are dangerous and expensive to
                        recreate in real life. In this project, we develop a
                        fully immersive VR kitchen that incorporates different
                        training scenarios. The VR kitchen makes use of a head-
                        mounted display, i.e., the Oculus Meta Quest 2 in our
                        case. The goal of this application is to teach those
                        skills through a gamified environment, which gives the
                        user an enjoyable experience. The gamification, in this
                        application, is designed for the purpose of achieving
                        the best learning outcome while diminishing as much as
                        possible the stress that accompanies a scoring system.
                        The choice of tools was made after in-depth research
                        comparing the best platforms for such a project; Unity
                        and C# make the best combination for this project.
